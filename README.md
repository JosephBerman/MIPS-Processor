# MIPS-Processor

Hi!

This is a repo for our semester long project in EECE2322, Fundamentals of Digital Design and Computer Organization, which ws to create a MIPS Processor using Verilog. 

There was some provided code by our professor to help intergrate the buttons on the PYNQ-Z board that we were using.

The code in this repo will not function without the code that the professor provided. This is purposely excluded to prevent any cheating in future classes.
